    <br>
    <p>As a <b>Data Analyst</b>, I love to make things that count.
        <br><br>
        Whether it's about making clean, efficient code, solving problems, or finding out new tools, I always believed in creating the future and not just keeping up with trends.
        <br><br>
        My passion is analyzing data, and I like to engage in projects that concern technology alongside world impact. 
        This philosophy influences my perspective on development; every project I build needs to have purpose and usability and make a positive impact.
        <br><br>
        My work is fueled by curiosity, a passion for solving problems and a conviction that technology should serve people, not the other way around.

        With a strong background in web administration and digital operations, I have worked with top agencies like <b>Leo Burnett</b>, <b>Honda Greece</b>, and <b>Publicis</b>. 
        <br><br>
        From <b>UX optimization</b> to <b>web design</b> and <b>IT solutions</b>, I have ensured smooth online experiences, data-driven decisions, and impactful brand presence.

    <br>
<p>
    I have already completed a <b>first-level Data Analyst</b> seminar, and I am thrilled to kick off a <b>Data Analyst Bootcamp</b>. 
    <br><br>
    I am looking forward to further more my skills and face more complex challenges in data analysis, with an emphasis on producing actionable insights and driving meaningful change.
