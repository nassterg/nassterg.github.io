👋 <b>Welcome to My Space on the Web</b>
<br><br>
"The best way to predict the future is to invent it." – Alan Kay<br><br>
Hi, I’m Nasos Stergiou, a Data Analyst passionate about building things that matter. Whether it’s writing clean, efficient code, solving problems, or exploring new technologies, I believe in creating the future rather than just following trends.
<br><br>
💡 <b>What I Do</b>
<br><br>
I specialize in Analyzing Data, and I enjoy working on projects that blend technology with real-world impact. This philosophy guides my approach to development—every project I build should have purpose, usability, and impact.<br>
 My work is driven by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and a belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around.<br><br>
"The computer is not the goal. It is the tool. The goal is the real world." – Ellen Ullman
<br><br>
🎯 <b>What Drives Me</b>
<br><br>
That’s why beyond just coding, I’m passionate about:
<br><br>
🚀 <b>Innovation & Learning</b> – Always exploring new technologies and ideas.<br>
📚 <b>Reading Books</b> – I enjoy diving into a wide range of genres, from novels to philosophy.<br>
🏃 <b>Marathon Training</b> – I’m a runner with a goal of participating marathons, constantly pushing myself to go further.<br>
🏊 <b>Swimming</b> – Whether it’s just for fun in the pool or training for open-water races, I love the challenge of the water.<br>
🚴 <b>Cycling</b> – Long rides are my escape, whether it's on a trainer or outside.<br>
🍳 <b>Cooking</b> – Because of my races training, I like and need to experiment with recipes, making meals from scratch, which helps me with my energy.<br>
💉 <b>Blood Donation</b> – I believe in giving back, and donating blood is one way I try to make a positive impact on my community.
