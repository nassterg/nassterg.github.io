👋 Welcome to My Space on the Web
"The best way to predict the future is to invent it." – Alan Kay
Hi, I’m Nasos Stergiou, a Data Analyst passionate about building things that matter. Whether it’s writing clean, efficient code, solving problems, or exploring new technologies, I believe in creating the future rather than just following trends.

💡 What I Do
I specialize in Analyzing Data, and I enjoy working on projects that blend technology with real-world impact. This philosophy guides my approach to development—every project I build should have purpose, usability, and impact.
 My work is driven by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and a belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around.
"The computer is not the goal. It is the tool. The goal is the real world." – Ellen Ullman

🎯 What Drives Me
That’s why beyond just coding, I’m passionate about:

🚀 Innovation & Learning – Always exploring new technologies and ideas.
📚 Reading Books – I enjoy diving into a wide range of genres, from novels to philosophy.
🏃 Marathon Training – I’m a runner with a goal of participating marathons, constantly pushing myself to go further.
🏊 Swimming – Whether it’s just for fun in the pool or training for open-water races, I love the challenge of the water.
🚴 Cycling – Long rides are my escape, whether it's on a trainer or outside.
🍳 Cooking – Because of my training for the race, I like and need to experiment with recipes, making meals from scratch, which helps me with my energy.
💉 Blood Donation – I believe in giving back, and donating blood is one way I try to make a positive impact on my community.
